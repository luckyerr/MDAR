# MDAR: A Multi-scene Dynamic Audio Reasoning Benchmark
## Overview
Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce MDAR, a benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. MDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated questionâ€“answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types.

## To-Do List
- [x] Release the MDAR paper.
- [x] Release the Benchmark and Code of Evalution.
- [ ] Release the Source Audios.
- [ ] Release the Complete README.
